Hello,

Originally from Vienna, in Austria, I am of French nationality. I completed my high school education at a french international school located in in Tokyo, Japan, where I cultivated my passion for japanese culture.

Currently living in Vienna, my hometown, I am immersed in the world of programming, currently focusing on C# and Unity for game development. I started learning programming languages less than a year ago.
So far my coding journey extends to languages like Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript for fullstack Developer and also C#. What started as a curiosity has transformed into a newfound love for coding, 
aligning seamlessly with my fascination for problem-solving and creativity.

I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to any endeavor I undertake.
