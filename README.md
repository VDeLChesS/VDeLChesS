Hello,

In my previous professional career, I have gained extensive experience in the field of 
customer service and after-sales. As a Credit Control Manager at GoStudent, I was 
responsible for optimizing incoming payments and coordinating outgoing refunds for 
over 18 months. This role sharpened my skills in handling financial data and gave 
me a deep understanding of payment processes. During my time as an insurance 
consultant and my 18 months in customer support at Allianz Partners GmbH, I was 
able to further develop my communication skills and deepen my competence in 
dealing with customers.
I speak fluent German, French, and English, which allows me to communicate 
effortlessly with customers and colleagues from different linguistic and cultural 
backgrounds.
I started programming independently a year ago, using the courses at the ZTM 
Online Academy as a guide. My journey began in the field of web development with 
Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Recently, I also started 
programming in C# and Java. Although I do not have much practical work 
experience, I am a fast learner and highly motivated to deepen my knowledge 
further.
