Hello,

I'm Victor, another individual with some diverse background and a will for continuous learning. Originally from Vienna, in Austria, I hold French nationality, 
reflecting my multicultural upbringing. I completed my high school education at a french international school located in in Tokyo, Japan, where I cultivated my passion for japanese culture.

Currently living in Vienna, my hometown, I am immersed in the world of programming, currently focusing on C# and Unity for game development. I started learning programming languages less than a year ago.
So far my coding journey extends to languages like Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript for fullstack Developer and also C#. What started as a curiosity has transformed into a newfound love for coding, 
aligning seamlessly with my fascination for problem-solving and creativity.

Beyond the digital realm, I am an avid traveler, always eager to explore new cultures and broaden my horizons. Mountain hiking is another passion that keeps me grounded and connected to nature. In addition to my technical interests, 
I am an enthusiast of foreign politics and also interested in history, with a particular fondness for French history spanning the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.

I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to any endeavor I undertake.
